This is/was my first javascript project from scratch. 

I thoroughly enjoyed it, I found it interesting to try and approach it with a variety of helper functions in mind. I have no doubt I've either overcomplicated the process or missed some simple things for efficiency here and there, regardless it was challenging yet fun to create. 

Things I've learned: 

1. How to create and link multiple functions
2. How to bring those functions together inside another function/for loop
3. How to approach error checking and general testing with console.log commands
    (this was a big one)
